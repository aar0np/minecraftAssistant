Crafting in Minecraft is the method by which the majority of items, blocks and tools are created. To craft an item move the ingredients from your inventory into the crafting grid and place them in the order representing the item you wish to craft. The 2x2 crafting grid is contained within the inventory screen and the 3x3 grid can be accessed from a crafting table. Select a category from the menu above or scroll down to view the recipes!
