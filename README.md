Question? What is the recipe for an iron helmet?
In Minecraft, the recipe for crafting an iron helmet requires 5 iron ingots. To craft it, you need to place the iron ingots in the following pattern on a crafting table (3x3 grid):

1. Place 3 iron ingots in the top row.
2. Place 1 iron ingot in the left slot of the middle row.
3. Place 1 iron ingot in the right slot of the middle row.

Here's a visual representation of the crafting grid:

```
[Iron Ingot] [Iron Ingot] [Iron Ingot]
[Iron Ingot] [Empty]     [Iron Ingot]
[Empty]      [Empty]     [Empty]
```

Once you have arranged the iron ingots in this pattern on the crafting table, you can then drag the iron helmet to your inventory.
